Dogs Are Man's Best Friend
10 Reasons Why Dogs Are Man's Best Friend
To put it simply, dogs are awesome. Whether they’re begging for your food, barking at their leash to convince you to take them on a walk, or simply greeting you when you get home, dogs do all of the little things that put smiles on faces around the world. What are some of the more endearing reasons why dogs are and always will be man’s best friend? Read on…<br>
1. Dogs have terrible short-term memories.<br>
One of the crappier aspects of human friends is that, generally speaking, they remember all of the times you’ve wronged them and will hold it against you for the rest of their lives. Dogs, on the other hand, have the “gift” of poor memory. That means you can mess with their tail, play keep away with their food, and tug on their ears to your heart’s content, even if it annoys them. You get to have your fun, and your dog will forget all about it and treat you like their best bud within a couple minutes! It’s truly one of the only win-win scenarios in life.<br>
2. Dogs have great long-term memories.<br>
While your pooch will forget you pulling on their tail, they won’t forget the connection they share with you, and, if you are good to them, you will leave a lasting impact on them that they’ll never shake off. Take, for instance, my dachshund Chester. From a young age he was babied by my mom, and now, nearly twelve years later, he never leaves her side. Unfortunately this sort of thing goes both ways, as I used to mess with him quite a bit on a consistent basis (actually I don’t think it had anything to do with me; he’s just too attached to my mom to like anyone else), and so nowadays he barks in my general direction whenever words of any sort come forth from my mouth.<br>
3. Dogs have your back.<br>
Even though my dog Chester isn’t exactly a huge fan of me, he’ll still take me over strangers. Now, when a dog actually likes me (like my dog Sally does), they’ll defend you even more vehemently. Whenever a creepy solicitor or girl scout cookie peddling entrepreneur knocks on your door, your dog will be right there beside you barking at them as you tremble behind a corner, too afraid to answer. Of course, this can go a little overboard, like this one time when the UPS guy showed up and tried to put a box on my porch, only to be chased away by three dogs rushing out to defend the homeland. Understandably, he now leaves packages by the front gate instead.<br>





What You Need to Know About Pet Raccoons<br>
Many people may not think of raccoons as pets but those who live with them find that they make fascinating and funny companions, although prone to a little, or maybe a lot, of mischief.<br><br>

<strong>Is It Legal to Own a Pet Raccoon?</strong><br>
Before even considering a raccoon as a pet you should be aware that they are illegal in many areas. Check with your local and state/provincial regulatory laws before pursuing the idea of having a raccoon as a pet.<br><br>


If raccoons are legal where you are then, and only then, should you start your search. It is best to obtain a pet raccoon from a breeder, although one may be difficult to find. Some have raised orphan raccoons as pets but this may also be illegal even in areas that you are allowed to have a captive bred pet raccoon.<br>

It is also best if your raccoon is used to being handled from an early age. This will help make them more social and less prone to biting you (raccoons are prone to biting, especially if they feel threatened, so be prepared that this may happen).<br><br>

<strong>How Long Do Raccoons Live?</strong><br>
Be prepared to make a long term commitment to a pet raccoon. They need lots of care and attention as well as supervision and if they are well cared for it is reasonable to expect them to live for 10-15 years. Just like any pet, you need to consider who can look after your pet raccoon if you go on vacation, pass away, or if something should happen that makes it so you cannot keep the raccoon.<br><br>

They can't be released back into wild so you should always have a back up plan.<br>

<strong>Veterinary Care for Pet Raccoons</strong><br>
Prior to getting your pet raccoon find a veterinarian who is willing to treat them. Even where raccoons are legal it may be difficult to find a vet who is willing to deal with them. Raccoons are susceptible to distemper and rabies and although they can be vaccinated with a canine killed rabies vaccine (it is unknown whether this vaccine is truly protective for raccoons), in the case of a human bite incident, regulatory agencies most likely will not accept the vaccine as effective and will confiscate or euthanize your raccoon.

Raccoons can develop all sorts of medical issues. Obesity, skin infections, fleas, intestinal parasites, urinary tract infections, and other problems may cause you to find yourself calling your vet so it is best to know who you're going to call.<br><br>

<strong>Feeding Raccoons</strong><br>
Raccoons are messy eaters because they like to dunk their food in their water dish prior to consuming it. A big variety of food, including dog food, insects, vegetables, fruits, and protein such as chicken are some of the items raccoons should be eating on a daily basis. Treats such as nuts and other fatty foods should be offered sparingly to prevent obesity and daily enrichment activities using food should also be performed.<br><br>

<strong>Housing Pet Raccoons</strong><br>
Raccoons are not small so most people who keep them in their house utilize a large dog crate to contain them when they aren't home. The majority of their time is spent roaming your house, playing, climbing on things, exploring, and being mischievous. They are too active to be content sitting in a cage for long periods of time.<br>





Aquarium for Beginner
Getting yourself into a new hobby is always exciting. If you are a beginner there is a lot to learn, a lot to see and there are tons of questions that may arise. Most popular question We ever heard from aquarium beginners is: “What kind of fish tank should be my first one?”<br>

If you were learning to drive you would not want to hit top speed in the first ride. No, you would probably want to take it slowly and be sure that you can control it. Keeping aquarium is not different. Don’t do what experts do. Try first something that almost anyone can do.<br><br>

<strong>Size of Aquarium</strong><br>

It’s a common question: “Is it okay if I get a large aquarium in the beginning or will it be too hard?”. The truth is. If you are beginner – the bigger is better. To some limits of course.<br>

The thing is. Bigger aquariums have more water and larger water masses are more stable. It is easier to maintain stable water temperature, it is easier to control ammonia, pH and other parameters of water. And for most beginners we would suggest to get as large aquarium as you can afford. In terms of money and space in your house. With some limitations as we said before.<br>

If you get too large one it might take much too long to perform weekly maintenance as there will be larger surfaces to clean, and more water to change. You might get frustrated by doing this job.<br>

And so. In a compromise to make it easy to maintain stable aquarium and not to quit it because it takes too much time. Our suggestion is that 80 to 150 liters (20 to 40 gallons) should be the best choice as beginner’s aquarium.<br><br>

<strong>Glass or Acrylic?</strong><br>

Definitely glass for beginners. Acrylic aquariums are easier to get scratched if cleaning is performed without extra caution. Don’t ruin your aquarium in the first months. Take the glass one and no worries. Scrub like a bulldozer if you like it.<br><br>

<strong>Water parameters</strong><br>

Freshwater, Saltwater, Reef? 

Saltwater and Reef aquariums are complex. Maintaining correct salt concentration is pretty hard task. Corrals are for higher education in Aquaristics only (it’s just a joke, but it’s hard for many experts).  Besides that, saltwater and reef aquariums and equipment is pricier than freshwater ones. Freshwater aquarium in our opinion is by far the best choice for beginners.<br><br>

<strong>Water temperature</strong><br>

On the one hand cold-water fish are easy. Just put them in a tank with water temperature close to room temp and that’s all. No heaters, no worries if power failure occurs.

On the other hand tropical aquariums are easy too. You add a heater and there are no worries if room temperature is going up and down. Aquarium has stable temperature because the heater does its job.

However, we would recommend cold-water aquarium for the beginners because cold-water fish are much more resistant to water parameter changes.<br><br>

<strong>Fish</strong><br>

We are looking for fish that are resistant to water parameter changes as maintaining water balance might be the hardest part for the beginners.<br>

If cold-water then it is definitely goldfish. They are comfortable in huge range of water temperature and are one of most popular fish in aquariums. Popularity results in loads of literature to read. Internet is full of articles starting from feeding, continuing to breeding and ending with medical care for goldfish. Do not choose a rare variety. You will lose benefits of having lots of literature and help available. And the fact is – rare varieties are often harder to keep.

Betta Splendens - Siamese Fighting Fish - Beginner FriendlyIf you chose tropical aquarium, then in the beginning get some of smaller fish like guppies or neon tetra. If you have larger aquarium try some labyrinth fish. They are famous for capability to survive in aquarium with low dissolved oxygen level. Great examples for beginner friendly fish might be Betta Splendens or some kind of Gouramis. Again, don’t choose too rare variety as explained before.

Of course there are a lot more to know about getting a beginner friendly fish. However, if you want to get it started and that’s it – our advices above are all you have to know at this point.

Mario’s first aquarium was 60 liters (~15 gallon) freshwater with goldfish in it. We guess it was a very good choice for a beginner. Although it might be larger.<br><br>

And what was (or will be) your first aquarium? We would love to hear it!
